INTRODUCTION  \nDue to the past technology, management and other \nreasons, different departments have established many science \nand technology service platforms according to the characteristics of the department s. There is a lack of unified \nplanning for the construction. The platform is relatively independent and scattered, showing fragmentation problems. The process and standard of platform application are not unified, and the science and technology service resources are overlapped. The problems not only cause the waste of valuable scientific and technological resources, but also lead to barriers in the use of users, difficulties in using service resources, increasing the cost of using service resources, and affecting the promotion of inn ovation. Especially in the era \nof big data, the total amount of data increases explosively, including massive data with different structures. How to \nmodify the integration mode of scientific and technological resources, establish a unifie d and perfect comprehensive \nscience and technology service resource sharing platform, adapt to the needs of new technologies and release the potential value of resources, has become the concern of governments, enterprises and  researchers at all levels. \nII. R\nELATED RESEARCH  \nScience and technology service resources can provide \nnecessary material and policy guarantees for innovation activities, promote scientific and technological innovation, assist decision-making at the scientific and technological level, and promote scientific research. They are important strategic resources for the country and various regions. Reference [1] defines science and technology service resources as including equipment needed for scientific \nresearch, science-related papers, data, and research results, \netc.; [2] refines the definition of science and technology service resources and puts forwa rd the \"five elements theory\", \nwhich are science and technology human resources, financial resources, equipment, information, policy and management r e s o u r c e s .

Scientific research human resources occupy a dominant position in all service resources; financial resources including the financial support needed in the \nprocess of scientific research, the main sources are self-financing of enterprises or research institutions, government financial appropriations, and bank loans; scientific and \ntechnological equipment resources mainly include various \nlarge-scale instruments and equipment used in the scientific research process.

Contents of science and tec hnology service resources \nIn response to these problems, the researchers have made \ncorresponding explorations. Reference [3] analyzes the types \nand corresponding characteristics of the integrated \ntechnology service resource integration platform. Reference [2][4] separately researches t he classification system of \nscience and technology resources and the optimization method of science and technology resource services. Reference [5] carried out the d evelopment process of large-\nscale scientific research instruments in south of China on the \nissue of how to integrate different types of resources, [6] discussed the design of the platform from the perspective of the actual needs of users; and in the specific platform architecture and implementation technical lev [7] introduced. \nBased on the distributed architecture system, [8] proposed to \nbuild a cloud platform model based on cloud computing virtual technology for the problems of different users in different geogr aphical areas. \nIn the context of the Internet of Everything, the total \namount of data doubles every 18 months or so [9]. The newly added massive amount of data has the characteristics of large volume, many types, fast increase speed [10], more \ninformation[11] and authenticity [12]. On the one hand, big \ndata has brought new opportunities to the development of technology service resource integration platforms. The rapid addition of scientific and technological service resources provides a new paradigm of thinking for innovation. The expansion of resources and convenient acquisition methods \nprovide a broad soil for scientific and technological \ninnovation. The threshold for obtaining professional knowledge is lowered and the speed of information processing is improved. Promote the production of scientific and technological achievements. On the other hand, big data also brings challenges and has a certain impact on the platforms and service models that provide scientific and technological service resources. Reference [13] believes that big data has increased demand for platform information search capabilities and informat ion security protection; [14] \nproposes that big data upgrades the platform's service methods and information organization mode; [15] explores the role of big data in promoting platform technology and the improvement of the structure and organization system. In terms of service mode, [16] believes that the ability to process real-time big data can affect the efficiency of information retrieval and user satisfaction with services; [17]  \nproposes that in the face of rapidly increasing massive amounts of big data, traditiona l technology service models \nhave not meet actual needs; [18] analyzes from the \nperspective of user demand changes and believes that in a big data environment, user needs for personalized and customized technology services will increase rapidly. However, the existing research lacks the analysis of the basic principles of the technology service resource integration platform under the background of big data, and the specific \nresearch on platform services and structural changes. \nIII. B\nIG DATA \nIn the environment of big data, the resource integration \nplatform faces not only massive data, but also a variety of \ntypes, especially unstructured data, which brings challenges \nto the platform's data storage capabilities and external servic e \ncapabilities. Faced with the core problems of users' \nincreasing individualization, complexity and new needs, and facing potential and future needs, explore how to design a reasonable \"smart\" technology service resource integration platform. \nA. Analysis of the basic functions of the platform \nThe integrated science and technology service resource \nintegration platform is an important part of the national \ninnovation system. Under the environment of big data, the platform is required to be large enough so that it can integrate massive amounts of data and be able to provide different services to the outside world. Limited to local services and a single service dimension. Aiming at the \nproblem of insufficient support capability of technological innovation under the new technology, the technological basic condition platform is analyzed, and the \"smart\" technological service resource integration sharing platform needs to meet the following basic functions: \nx Comprehensive science and technology service resources; The integration platform of science and technology service resources gathers and configures various scattered science and technology service \nresources, realizes the heterogeneous storage and \nunified scheduling and management of different types of resources, and expands the breadth and depth of data. The cornerstone of integrated platform construction; \nx Integration of service resources; on the basis of resource aggregation, the planned decomposition and reorganization of heterogeneous resources, the establishment of a unified resource description and retrieval method, the establishment of links between various resources, and the realization of different types of scientific and technological services Integrated sharing of resources; \nx The main body of supply and demand docking; on the one hand, through the use of micro-service architecture and other method s, to meet the increasing \ncomplexity and individual needs of users, and \n81\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA. Downloaded on March 03,2024 at 18:46:42 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. improve the utilization of resources; on the other hand, \nusers who demand scientific and technological resources may become suppliers. Provide scientific and technological wisdom, scientific and technological patents, etc., and provide docking guidance for role conversion through the service platform; \nx The scalability and security of the service resource platform; with the advancement of science and technology, there are more and more demands for scientific and technological services, and the demands are gradually becoming more complex and personalized. The platform must face the future and provide new services leaving room for expansion, \nsecurity puts forward requi rements for data storage, \nfailure recovery, and network attacks. \nBased on the purpose of the technology service resource \nintegration platform to serve users and the future-oriented strategic positioning of the resource service platform, the needs of the technology service resource integration platform are macroscopically divided int o three categories, which are \nbased on actual demand and after a period of development. The potential needs of users, th e future needs that try to infe r \n[19]. The actual demand based on reality refers to the demand for scientific and technological resources proposed by users on the platform according to the actual demand. This demand is clear and can be  accurately obtained; while \nthe potential demand refers to the in-depth exploration of the \nuser's actual demand, combined with the user. The portraits of different types of service resources are used for statistical \nand comprehensive analysis, and the results of the hidden \ndemand mining. This kind of demand is relatively a kind of prediction, but the platform needs to meet the needs of users. Timely and targeted adjustment and optimization; future demand is based on various data and various national policies and strategies, combined with the development areas of different industries, and a judgment on future technological needs is relatively vague. Demand, but it is the development form of the future platform. The analysis of the overall framework helps the platform to have a macro-control over the purpose of the different stages of the platform and the functions that need to be realized in the process of platform construction. \nThe integrated platform realizes the transformation of the \ntechnology service model, from the original \"point-to-point\" \nservice model in which users apply for service resources on the decentralized dep artmental platform to the new \"point-to-\nface\" model. The required sc ientific and technological \nresources can be applied for on ce, and the required packaged \ncomplete scientific and technological service resources can be obtained. The transformation of service mode promotes the precise supply of scientific and technological services and improves the utilization rate of scientific and technological services. \nB. Accurate identification and mining of needs under big \ndata \nThe precise identification of technological service needs \nmainly includes the feature extraction of technological \nservice demand and the classification of technological \nservice resource demand types. In terms of the characteristics of technological service demand, due to the promotion of big data, the difficulty of acquiring knowledge is reduced, the competition for innovation is becoming increasingly fierce, and users\u2019 demand for technological resources is time-sensitive; and there are fewer channels for acquiring technological services, and related demand services are difficult to replace. Rigidity and the threshold for technological innova tion has increased. In addition to \nscientific and technological lite rature, related instruments \nand equipment are also required, and the demand for resources is complex. In terms of the types of scientific and technological service resource needs, there are different classification methods based on different dimensions, for example, according to the occ upational classification of \nresource demand users, the user\u2019s  personal scientific research \nneeds, scientific research institutes and even universities; industries according to scientific and technological needs \nClassification, including new energy, new materials, \nintelligent manufacturing, and so on. \nAccurate identification of the needs of scientific and \ntechnological services is an important feature of the \"smart\" integrated sharing platform. After identifying the needs of different users, a unified standard format description of the actual needs of scientific research services is required to clarify the actual scientifi c and technological service \nresources used, accurate refinement. At the same time, in the above process, the user\u2019s portrait needs to be transformed and stored in detail in a unified format, and the user\u2019s scientific research experience, the purpose of using resources, and the existing research results must be investigated and summarized in detail. It is conducive to the targeted adjustment and optimization of the integrated platform \naccording to the actual situa tion during the use of the \nintegrated platform to better meet the needs of users. \nC. The impact of big data on the overall service model of the \nplatform \nIn the environment of big data, the needs of users have \ngradually changed from the t raditional \u201cwhatever the \nplatform can provide\u201d to the demand for the platform \naccording to their actual need s. The user completes the \ntransition from passive acceptance to active proposal. Therefore, the platform also needs to address sexual changes, based on the actual needs of users, conduct in-depth analysis and identification, accurately mine potential needs, describe \nuser needs in a standardized way, summarize and summarize \nthe needs of different users, and propose future possibilities Speculate on the demand. As shown in Fig. 2, it shows the changing trend of the service model during the evolution of the platform. The details are as follows: \n \nFig. 2.  Evolution process of service  resource integration platform \n(1) Service integration driven by demand \nIn the \"smart\" platform exploration stage, users are still at \nthe level of \"passively\" receiving scientific and technological  \n82\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA.

Restrictions apply. service resources, and scientific and technological service \nresources include a wide variety of resources, including resources such as instruments and documents that can be easily quantified, as well as scientific and technological guidance and technical research. And other resources that are difficult to quantify. In the era of big data, different heterogeneous the resource differences and unique advantages of resources will be amplified and difficult to replace. Therefore, it is necessary to format and store these heterogeneous resources, and continue to collect relevant data to improve the continuity of service data. \n(2) Service specialization ba sed on efficiency traction \nUsers have different educational backgrounds and \nindustry backgrounds, and there are certain differences between different industries. The user's demand for scientific \nand technological services has  s h o w n  \" c o a r s e \"  t o  \" f i n e \" ,  \n\"Broad\" to \"Fine\" characteristic s. Therefore, it is necessary \nto establish targeted profession al services, improve the types \nof scientific and technological resources and information in \ndifferent fields of the platform in various industries, and meet the needs of users f or specialized resources. \n(3) Service personalization based on user orientation \nThe individualized needs gradually become prominent, \nwhat include two aspects. From the analysis of users' \nindividualized needs, with the increase of users, different users have different requirements for scientific and technological service resources. And the way of obtaining resources also changes with changes in technology. While mobile, digital and other methods are convenient for users, it also requires that the services provided by the platform can \nbe changed according to the indivi dual needs of users; on the \nother hand, from the perspective of service integration \nplatforms Analysis shows that the platform can provide more accurate services with personalized features based on the user's portrait. \n(4) Service intelligence based on innovation guidance \nIn the stage of continuous development of the \"smart\" \nplatform, innovation capabilities continue to increase, the difficulty of data collection is reduced, and the dimensions of  \ndata obtained are more. The platform can analyze these user data using intelligent methods, using machine learning and data analysis. And other advanced information technologies, establish user portraits that use resources, and accurately identify hidden needs; at the same time, the platform intelligently analyzes the int egrated resources, and uses \nvisualization and other means to gather various integrated service application scenarios. Organize and mine the data, turn various hidden resources into explicit resources, and realize the value-added of resources. \nThrough analysis of the impact of big data on the service \nmode of the science and technology service resource integration platform, the arch itecture system is effectively \nchanged in response to the changes in the service mode of the science and technology resource integration platform construction to better meet the actual needs of users. \nIV. M\nICROSERVICES  \nBecause microservices can r ealize service splitting and \nreconstruction, [20] introduced microservice architecture in the construction of a new type of community education resource sharing platform and commercial online education system, automatic load balancing configuration. \nA. The advantages of microservices \nThe containers of the microservice architecture are \nisolated from each other thr ough software, and each \ncontainer has an independent environment. Therefore, the development, maintenance, and launch of the container do \nnot affect each other. Combined with the system fuse \nmechanism, the high availability of the system is achieved and the user's downtime is reduced. The use of microservice \ntechnology to build an integration platform also needs to follow several basic construction principles to ensure that the microservice architecture meet s the actual needs of the \nplatform. The specific pr inciples are as follows: \n1) The principle of functional uniqueness. When refining \nspecific functions, it is necessary to accurately divide the specific function boundaries of each microservice. In this \nway, ensure that the functions of the microservice are clear; \n2) The principle of service independence. Each \nmicroservice has an independent operating environment in all aspects of development, deployment and operation, which \nimproves the interdependence of microservices and reduces \nthe coupling between microservices; \n3) The principle of light-weight communication. Each \nservice of microservices can meet normal user needs and run independently, and there are relatively few communication requirements between microservices. \nThe containers of the microservice architecture are \nisolated from each other thr ough software, and each \ncontainer has an independent environment. Therefore, the development, maintenance, and launch of the container do not affect each other. Combined with the system fuse mechanism, the high availability of the system is achieved and the user's downtime is reduced of perception. \nB. Integrated platform architecture based on microservices \n \nFig. 3.  Integrated platform architecture based on microservices \nThe specific microservice-b ased technology service \nresource integration platform architecture system is shown in \nFig. 3.

Second, the microservices are split \nand the microservices are used. The container technology in the service, and then build different modules such as resource configuration, communication, calculation, to realize the underlying arch itecture of the system. \nV. C\nONCLUSION  \nThrough mining and impact analysis on the needs of \nusers in the big data era, on the basis of absorbing and summarizing the relevant big data, technology service integration sharing platform, this paper systematically designs a \"smart\" integration based on the microservice architecture. The science and technology service resource integration platform increase the service efficiency and \nservice accuracy of the platform , improves the utilization rate  \nof science and technology services, meets the needs of users for innovation, and realizes the continuous development of the technology service resource integration platform. \nA\nCKNOWLEDGMENT  \nThis work is partially supported by the National Key \nResearch and Development Plan of China (2017YFB1401600). \nR\nEFERENCES  \n[1] L.H.

I NTRODUCTION\nThe traditional method of launching a mobile-based appli-\ncation into the market uses native applications. The nativeapplications are available on the App Store or Play Storeand are installed on devices for development and testingpurposes. However, application development using any nativeapplication requires a considerable amount of cost and time.Many startups do not possess that many resources and thusface delays in product delivery processes. The ProgressiveApp Development (PW A) approach is a great boon in suchscenarios, as the time and effort required to build a PW Aare less when compared to a native application. In essence,a PW A is a web interface with an appearance and behavior\nsimilar to a native mobile app that can be used for application\ndevelopment. The PW As also greatly support rapid prototyp-ing. A Rapid prototype is a small-scale working prototypeof the project in hand that can be used for user testing andconcept validation. Such a prototype must be cost-effective,\nfast and easy to modify. Such prototyping allows startups to\nfail early. Rather than investing time and effort into buildinga native application and then failing, making a PW A rapidprototype is very cost and time-ef\ufb01cient. Moreover, PW As areeasier to change than native apps and hence can be used forA/B testing in the early stages of product development. Thus\nthe most costly process of building a the \ufb01nal product can beshielded from requirements change by using PW As for rapid\nprototyping and testing.\nAs PW A is still an emerging domain of research, the\npaper aims at providing an overview of the methodology,compare it with traditional development approaches and give\na experimental analysis of advantages with application devel-opment with PW A. The claims in this study are supported andvalidated using an application developed using PW A that aimsat identi\ufb01cation and veri\ufb01cations of students at the securitygates of a university campus.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section I introduces the\npaper. Section II describes the literature survey of progressiveweb applications. Section III offers a new methodology thatreduces the time required for testing of mobile applicationsusing PW As. Section IV describes the advantages of PW As\nover Native applications in the context of rapid prototyping,\nwhile section V describes its advantages over web applications.Section VI presents the experimental results of PW A testingtesting and \ufb01nally, section VII concludes the paper.\nII. L\nITERA TURE SURVEY\nResearchers have been studying and practising more ef-\nfective ways of software development. PW A is one of thestrong candidates of such studies. The PW A concept was \ufb01rstintroduced by Google in 2015. Since then, PW A developmenthas been rapidly gaining popularity [5] [1]. It is considered an\nemerging technology with tremendous potential in the future.\nPW As can be cached easily and increase user engagement[21]. Some popular PW As include Uber, Spotify and Flipcart[9]. PW As are especially bene\ufb01cial for startup enterprises.Many studies have been carried out on PW As that comparethem against traditional native or web applications. Bi\u00f8rn-Hansen and others [11] [12] have scrutinized and comparedPW As against cross-platform app development approaches.They have tested various types of applications for performancewith the help of two case studies. Tandel and Jamadar [22]have discussed the impact of PW A on web development. Theyhave compared the features provided by Naive applications,general applications and PW As. Mole [19] reviewed the dif-ferent issues and challenges in cross-platform developmentand its applications, discussed the approaches that may resolvethese issues and discussed how the PW A addressed the issues.Lee and others [18] have studied the security and privacy ofPW As. They have identi\ufb01ed security and design \ufb02aws in PW Adevelopment. Fournier [14] has compared the performanceof PW A and native applications in terms of smoothness,memory and CPU usage.

Frankston [15] exploredvarious aspects of PW As. Recently, Fauzan and others [13]have provided a literature review on PW As.\nPW A development has been discussed in various project re-\nviews and theses. Rensema [20] has explained various aspectsof PW A development like compatibility, performance, security,privacy, and user/business impact along with use cases. Lama[17] has discussed the technical details of PW A development\nincluding core tech, design, tools, and technologies. Kerssens[16] has studied the difference in the performance of PW Aswith native and traditional web applications. They have shownthat the performance and energy consumption of a PW Ais at least similar or even slightly better when compared\nto the traditional approaches of Native and Web in mobile\ndevelopment. A summary of all the observations of the studies\ncan be found in table ??.\nV arious sources on the internet provide useful information\non Progressive web applications. Web.dev [9] provides variouscase studies on PW A development. Google\u2019s PW A website [4]\nalso provides various resources for PW A development. In this\nstudy, we aim to utilize PW A for rapid testing of ideas fornew products. To our knowledge, there has been no previousstudy on this speci\ufb01c topic.\nIII. P\nROPOSED METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we propose a methodology for the testing\nof a mobile application product.\nThe most expensive and time-consuming stage of mobile\napp development is the production stage. Building any featurein the native mobile application requires time. The feature hasto go through stages like development, testing and deployment.However, in the early stages of product development, manyideas fail. This means that if a feature that has been builtdoes not become a success, all time and resources are wasted.PW As can help to minimize this risk of wastage by providinglow-cost testable prototypes of the features. The developmentof a feature in PW A is cheaper when compared to nativeapplications. If new features are built \ufb01rst using PW As, theycan be tested on real users. Moreover, multiple variants of thesame idea can be A/B tested on PW A applications in a veryeasy manner. This testing can be done across all platformson real users. If the feature idea fails, only a small amountof effort is lost. If the idea is a success, then the samefeature can be built on native applications. The time taken\nto build this feature on the native application can be used totest new features in PW A in parallel. This way ensures theminimization of failure risk. The \ufb02owchart above shows theprocess using PW A. The same methodology can be appliedto the initial prototype development and ideation process. Theprocess without PW A is shown in \ufb01gure III. The methodologyproposed is shown in \ufb01gure III.\nFig. 1. Methodology without PW A\nIV . A DV ANT AGES OF PW A OVER NA TIVE APPS\nPW As have numerous advantages. Many of them have been\ndiscussed in detail by many references [11] [17] [19] [5]. In\nthis section, only the advantages of PW A that are relevant tothe context of Rapid prototyping are discussed.\nA. Ease of development\nPW As are seen as a uni\ufb01er between native and web applica-\ntions [11]. Since a progressive web application is built usingthe same tools as websites, thus providing compatibility withits web app versions [5]. Almost every web application can be\neasily converted into a PW A. Recent conversions of web apps\nto PW A for desktops include Y ouTube, Google Drive, Twitter,and Facebook.\nPW As can be built using the exact same tools as any other\nweb application. This provides the following advantages in thecontext of startups -\n2\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA. Downloaded on February 21,2024 at 13:42:13 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. Fig. 2. Proposed methodology with PW A\n1) This makes the development process faster.\n2) Less cost of development.3) Less talent is required than native application builders.4) Ease of development provides lesser training time.\nB. Multiplatform\nOne of the most important advantages of PW A for startup\nenterprises is the lesser overhead of development across\nvarious platforms. The write-once-use-anywhere bene\ufb01t ofPW As drastically reduces the cost of development, testing andmaintenance.\n1) Operating systems compatibility: PW As can be con\ufb01g-\nured to be installed on any mobile device as well as desktop.Both IOS [6] and Android systems support PW As in varyingcapabilities. PW A can be installed on Macintosh systems(OSX), Windows OS, and Linux OS variants as well as canbe run through all supported browsers. This power of PW Amakes it a popular choice for various applications that needto be run on mobile as well as desktop [5]. PW As can runon almost all major operating systems and devices includingAndroid and IOS mobiles, Ipads, and Chrome Books.\nThe table IV -B1 summarizes the features provided by PW As\non different platforms. This multiplatform feature makes test-ing across users with various devices easier. Currently, only\nFlutter is the most popular framework with the multiplatformfeature.T ABLE II\nCOMP A TIBILITY OF PW A ACROSS MOBILE FRAMEWORKS .\nFeature Android - Google IOS - Safari\nWeb Push Noti\ufb01cations Available Not Available\nOf\ufb02ine Browsing Available Available\nBackground Synchronization Available Not Available\nApp launching screen Available Not Available\nAdd to the home screen Available Available\nBluetooth Available Not Available\nGeolocation Available Available\nGeofencing Not Available Not Available\nImage Capture Available Available\nVideo Capture Available Available\nHost on Store Available Available\n2) Browser compatibility: Chromium-based browsers pro-\nvide support for PW A on all devices except iOS and iPadOS.As of now, iOS and iPadOS users have to use Safari forinstalling web applications. Firefox does not support PW Aexcept for partial support for Android devices.\nC. No Update is required\nIn the case of native applications, users have to be bothered\nagain and again to update the application. This prevents theapplication from making small and numerous test cycles.Except for Over The Air (OT A) updates, other updates needto be veri\ufb01ed by Google or Apple before they can be im-plemented. This further restricts the time to market for rapid\ntest cycles. All this can be reduced by using PW As whichdo not need frequent explicit updates. PW As can synchronizeand update in the background. More details on the background\nsynchronization of PW A can be found in the study done byBehl and Raj [10]. This feature is very useful for the followingcases -\n1) Testing can be done as frequently as possible.\n2) Features per test can be narrowed down to 1.3) No requirement for testing updates from third-party stores.\nD. Easier A/B testing\nA/B testing is an important method for the development\nof any product. A/B testing helps reduce errors, \ufb01nd the bestideas and reduce guesswork early in the product development\ncycle. Such experiments are done by many large companies\non a routine basis. PW As are far easier to test than nativeapplications. For example, if a certain feature needs to beA/B tested, then only that webpage can be modi\ufb01ed intotwo versions, instead of making two versions of the entireapplication. This modular approach makes the addition of\nnew features as well as A/B testing cost and time-effective.\nBuilding a PW A is similar to building a web application andchanges can be easily performed. This makes it easier for A/Btesting\nE. Low size\nIn the case of prototypes, the brand image is not fully set up.\nDue to the uncertain feature set and large scope of errors in thetesting phase, it is likely that users have not fully subscribedto the product. In such cases, if the application is consuming\n3\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA. Downloaded on February 21,2024 at 13:42:13 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

However, a PW A takes a very less amount ofstorage space in the application. This is ideal for users who\ndo not have data or storage to download the application. Acomparison between the download size of PW As and theirnative versions can be seen in table IV -E.\nF . Lesser loading time\nPW As are faster than native applications [2]. Due to the\ntransition from server-side to client-side as well as cachinginformation, the loading speed for the application is drastically\nreduced, thus providing a seamless experience to the users. In\na startup scenario where there are multiple competitors andno brand name, reducing the time latency in users is critical.Lesser loading time leads to more user retention and morerevenue. According to a case study, every additional second\nof page load time resulted in 15-20% lower revenue and sales.By reducing this load time, Orange Polska S.A. was able to\nconvert 52% better by optimizing its PW A [9] This is trueeven for the prototyping of the product. Consider the scenariowhere users are installing a new application which they havenever heard of before. The reduction of friction between users\nand the application in such cases will increase the usageof the application. According to a case study, Tinder PW Aincreased the usage of the application when compared to anative application [9].\nG. No third-party stores required\nPW As can be directly installed from the browser. This is\nadvantageous as the app can be tested on real users withouthaving to launch the application on the Apple app store orGoogle Play store. Currently, the App Store requires an annual\nfee of $99, accompanied by a long waiting time till theapplication gets accepted.\nHowever, the most advantageous bene\ufb01t of this feature is\nthat the users are not required to be redirected to the storesto install an application. This makes the cost of attractingconsumers to their mobile website becomes substantially lowerthan the cost of driving app downloads. Convincing users toinstall a PW A directly from a browser is simpler for the usersthan forcing them to go through the app store. App storescan distract users from the \ufb02ow due to network downloadissues and large download times. App stores also providealternative options to users which may include competitors.These disadvantages are prominent for startup applicationswhere getting the user to use the application is of utmostimportance. On the other hand, by using the PW A application,\nthe time of the user does not get wasted. The PW A runs onthe browser directly before installation, thus enabling the userto use the application before installation. Installation of theapplication and usage can occur simultaneously unlike nativeapplications which need to be installed \ufb01rst before usage.According to a case study, the number of transactions forMishiPay increased 10 times by cutting the installation steprequired for native applications [9]. The process of nativeapplication installation is explained in the \ufb02owchart IV -G andthe PW A installation process is explained in \ufb02owchart IV -G.\nFig. 3.

Other Advantages\n1) PWAs are Discoverable: PW As are easier to discover\nthan native applications through mobile browsers. This isuseful for scaling users after testing of idea.\n2) Lesser Skill set required: PW As require the same set as\nweb development. PW As can be built using HTML, CSS andJavascript. This reduces the cost of hiring. The 2022 surveyfor commonly used language among professional developersby stack exchange [8] shows 67.9% responses for Javascript54.93% HTML and 40.08% for typescript. This is very highwhen compared to 33.4% for Java 9.92% for Kotlin, 6.67%for Dart and 5.18% for Swift.\n3) Lesser Mobile Fragmentation: Native mobile applica-\ntions running on different versions of operating systems makesnative application development costly. This can be avoided inthe testing phase by using progressive web applications. PW As\nare affected by fragmentation to a lesser extent when compared\nto native applications [3].\nV. A\nDV ANT AGES OF PW A OVER WEB APPS\nThere are many case studies that describe how companies\nbene\ufb01tted by converting their web applications to PWas.\nGoibibo improved its conversion rate by 60% by converting itsmobile application to a PW A. Blibli improved its revenue by10x by providing PW A for its\u2019 returning users. Nikkei saw 2.3xmore organic traf\ufb01c accompanied by 58% more conversions.Apart from these, many other enterprises like Infobae, voot\nhave bene\ufb01ted from the conversion. In this section, we describe\nthe advantages of PW A over web applications for new producttesting. All these case studies are available at the Web.devwebsite [9].\nA. Instability\nPW As look like Native apps on the app screen. This has the\nfollowing advantages- Provides access point - The Icon in theapp screen is an easy way to access the application users do\nnot have to go to the webpage.1) Reminds users - Acts as a constant reminder to use the app.This is not present in Web applications.2) Noti\ufb01cation remainder in the icon - The number of noti-\n\ufb01cations of the application is clearly visible on the app icon\nattracting users\u2019 attention in case of any noti\ufb01cation.3) Application-like feel - there is very little difference betweenthe feel of native applications and PW As for the users. Thisis not present for mobile applications.Currently, Android devices support the \u2018add to home screen\u2019feature for any website. However, PW As provide advantageslike custom icons on the home screen, default names, noti\ufb01ca-tion icons and splash screens. One example of this is Rakuten24. As a new service, Rakuten 24 increased its performanceby 450% through the use of PW A. One of the key factors\ninvolved in this was its installability [9].\nB. Visibility on Google Play Store\nPW As can also be visible on Google Play Store. This is\nuseful in the later stages of testing when the applicationhas been opened to public usage. Users can search for the\napplication in the Play Store in a similar manner as any nativeapplication. Moreover, applications are indexed and can alsobe advertised in the Play Store in a similar manner as nativeapplications. Currently, this feature is available only on the\nMicrosoft Store and Google Play Store.\nC. Of\ufb02ine performance\nPW As can Cache data and operate of\ufb02ine in a method\nsimilar to Native applications. This is useful for low bandwidthusage. JD.ID improved its mobile conversion rate by 53%with caching strategies, installation, and push noti\ufb01cations [9].Frequently used data like images or home screen assets canbe cached to make the application usable in of\ufb02ine mode.\nD. Service workers.\nService workers are proxy servers that are intermediate\nbetween web applications, the browser, and the network [7].It is a JavaScript \ufb01le which runs separately from the browser.Service workers used in PW As are capable of backgroundprocessing. This ensures an instant and reliable experience forusers, just like native applications. In Twitter PW A, fast userexperience on \ufb01rst load and subsequent views enables usersto view and create Tweets as quickly as possible [9].\nVI. E\nXPERIMENT AL RESUL TS\nTo validate the research \ufb01ndings the experimentation\ninvolved development of A Progressive Web applicationprototype for a university campus application. It involved\na digital Identity Card Portal for security veri\ufb01cation at aUniversity that has over 40,000 students. In order to test theworking of the same, a Progressive Web Application wasdeveloped. The following observations were found during thetesting phase.1) Ease of Development - The PW A prototype was\neasily developed by one single student with minimum skillrequirements. The only skill required was HTML and V anillaJS. The prototype was completed in 20 man-hours2) Multiplatform - Single PW A was suf\ufb01cient for both\niPhone and Android users. Traditional applications could nothave been tested on real iPhone users. It could also be runfrom any computer system in the campus.3)No Update required - Iterative testing could be easily\nperformed due to these features.4)Low size and 5) Lesser Loading time enabled testing\nto be hassle-free on limited bandwidth areas of the campus.Students could use the application in 5-10 seconds only. Onthe other hand, installing a similar mobile application requires2-3 minutes to install. The size of the PW A was only 2Mbwhile a similar mobile application takes 30 MB.6)No APK requirement enabled students to easily access\nthe application through QR codes. This enabled easier testingof the application. QR code leading to the website madethe process of usage and downloading much easier than thetraditional process of APK installation followed by usage.This bene\ufb01t of likability and sharability was one of the most\n5\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA.

Restrictions apply. profound in the entire process.\n7)Instability Makes it easier for the students to use than a\nwebsite as it can be easily opened directly from the homescreen without much effort.8) Of\ufb02ine performance enabled students to use the\napplication without the requirement of connectivity.\nIn the above case study, progressive web applications played\na vital role in the development of the digital Identity Card Por-tal. The PW A prototype has enabled the testing of the idea intoa small sector of the university. This can be scaled up graduallyand the results of its performance can be incorporated in thefuture versions of the product. A/B testing can be performedeasily on various students to \ufb01nd out what they exactly needand improve the product. All of these activities would havetaken more resources in terms on time and computations hadit been a native or a web-only application.\nBased on these experimental experiences, it can be con-\ncluded that PW A provides bene\ufb01ts of both speed of develop-\nment similar to web applications with interface and featuresof native applications; it can be used for prototyping of nativeapplications before they are built. PW As can be used to createa working model of the \ufb01nal product in a smaller time andat a lower cost. It can be used to test and improve ideas\nat varying scales. The PW A approaches are advantageous\nover native applications especially in the scenario of newbrand inceptions and resources are limited. They can betremendously useful like the scenario discussed in the casestudy, where students/more users were responsible for theproduct development. Thus it can be concluded that PW As\nare a very useful tool for bringing any new app-based product\ninto the market.\nVII. C\nONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE\nThis paper proposes a new methodology that can speed\nup mobile application-based product testing. It also elaboratesadvantages of PW As over traditional applications as well asweb applications in the context of rapid prototyping. The pro-posed methodology reduces risks and time for \ufb01nding product\nmarket \ufb01t. The progressive web applications for testing and\nprototyping of new products can be effectively used to lowerthe risk and failure costs of features in a product at its earlystages. With PW A, the product development, product releaseand testing new features can take place concurrently, thusreducing the initial development costs. This has been made\npossible due to the novel feature of PW As being easier andfaster to develop, cross-platform and easy to deploy. ThusPW As can prove a powerful tool for the rapid development\nof prototypes for especially for start-ups. Instead of investingtime and resources in developing native applications, startupscan now focus on iterating through their ideas at a minimal\ncost.\nThe future scope of this study consists of the study of\nscaling of PW A products. V arious methodologies related to thescaling and native app transition phase of PW A prototypes canbe investigated. V arious aspects of non-LEAN methodologycan be studied in the context of PW A applications. A wareness\nof this methodology needs to be done in startups. Lastly,process metrics need to be established for this methodology.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] The history of pwa development \u2014 the pwa book.\nhttps://www.divante.com/pwabook/chapter/02-the-history-of-pwas.\n(Accessed on 05/10/2023).\n[2] How fast is pwa? check this pwa demo to \ufb01gure it out - tigren.\nhttps://www.tigren.com/blog/pwa-demo/.

Students of Data \nScience area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical \nindicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy \nto lost interests and patience during the process of learning \nprogramming and analysis proce ss, such as R-language. Stock \nmarket, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy  to attract student attentions. \nThus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education \npurpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. \nThe exploring window shows current and historical stock price \ntrends and related indicators. Several representative stocks \nfrom different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control wi ndow allows students to develop \ntheir own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or thro ugh single or combinations of \nindicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module.  The report window demonstrates the \nexpected return of a stock in a specific time frame through a \nspecific strategy. A more comprehensive report with detailed \ntransaction information is also provided for back-testing \npurpose. Students are involved into the development of the \nsoftware and get experience for R-programming. Preliminary \nversion of the product has been tested and surveyed in a data \nscience classroom. About ten junior Data Science students have \npracticed and provided feedback. The positive survey results \nshow the feasibility of the approac h. In the future, artificial \nintelligent component will be in tegrated into the platform.  \nKeywords\u2014 Data Science; Trading Platform; R-\nProgramming \nI.INTRODUCTION\nWe are facing the age of da ta, enriched with big data, \nunstructured data, mixed media data, you name it. The \nacademia and industry commun ities are requesting for a new \nclass of experts who can extract actionable knowledge from rich and varied datasets. Huge amounts of data with complex structures in the form of text, video, and streaming data are routinely collected in social networks (e.g., Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter), biological and health sciences \n(e.g., drug discovery, patient care), sciences and engineering \n(e.g., astronomy, networks, smart buildings), business and industry (e.g., automotive, robotics, banking, insurance, ad networks) as well as by government and society at large. Data engineers will help quantify and address the pressing concerns of modern society, including those in healthcare, \nsustainability, security, equ ity, and economics. However, \nundergraduate programs in the area of Data Science or Data Engineering are still few. And most existing programs are focusing on theories and algorithms, which are generally hosted by Mathematics or Statistics department. The software development and data base management challenges \nare usually ignored by those schools. \n Faculty at Gannon University, especially those in the \nDepartment of Computer and Information Science (CIS), have offered selective courses and have been active in scholarship in Data Science and Engineering. A series of data-project-based collaborati ons between CIS faculty and \nfaculty from other departments, such as Criminal Justice, \nPhysical Therapy and Environmental Engineering, has been occurring on campus. Due to the growing demands for graduates in the data area, a group of CIS faculty worked \ntogether to establish this pioneer educational program. The \nprogram focuses on data science (data analytics data modeling, machine learning, and etc.) and data engineering (cloud computing, database management, business intelligent systems, and etc.). The curriculum was developed by three factors: 1) the benchmark of other universities that have similar, but different programs; 2) the understanding of the development trend of big data in both academia and industry worlds; and 3) the reality of the faculty\u2019s expertise and scholarship focus within the CIS department.  \nDuring the enhancement of Data Science and \nEngineering program, one of the challenges in our actual teaching experiences is how to involve students into real-world data and inspire their inte rests. Therefore, a simulated \ntrading platform is designed and developed for education \ngoal.  \nII.A\nLGORITHIMIC TRADING AND RELATED TREND\nAs banks continue to update themselves and enter the\nmodern era, there is a big need for profitable and reliable \nalgorithms that can earn bette r returns than humans can do \nalone. The New York Times [1], Wall Street Journal [2] and \nmany other media have noticed the power of applying data \nscience and engineering into stock market. According to C. Metz, \u201cNytimes, (2017), artificial Intelligence - powered stock trading is an increasingly hot topic\u201d.  \nThe idea of using computers to trade stocks is hardly new. \nAlgorithmic trading has been around for well over a decade and rapidly gaining in popularity. Figure 1 demonstrates the historical trend of algorithmic trading vs percentages of market volume. Today, upwards of 90% of trading is conducted by computer programs. [4] \n5\n2020 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Educational Informatization (CSEI)\n978-1-7281-7008-4/20/$31.00 \u00a92020 IEEE\nXinxiang, China\u2022June 12-14, 2020\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA. Downloaded on March 03,2024 at 18:58:04 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.  \nFig. 1.  Trend of Algorithmic Trading.  \nRecently, more companies o ffer AI-driven investing for \nthe average person. For a single investor with \u2013  tens of \nthousands of dollars to invest, they don\u2019t need advanced hedge fund technology \u2013 they just need some software that can allocate their funds into a simple and smart investment portfolio, and for them to consult as their needs, or the \nmarket changes [3]. \nIII. S\nOFTWARE AND DATA DESIGN  \nA. Software Architecture \nThe simulation software (as Fig 2) contains three \ncomponents: 1) Yahoo Finance server, which provides free \nand real-time stock data. 2) a local server, which is a server hosted in department. Its major role is to collect historical data and provide necessary computing for students. 3) user interface, which is the self-d eveloped trading platform to \ndemonstrate stocks information and to enable student to implement trading strategy.  The local server and user \ninterface are implemented based on the web framework in R, \nnamed Shiny. \n \nFig. 2.  Software Architecture \nB. R Packages \nIn this project, R studio is used as development \nenvironment. The version of R used in this project is 3.3.2, \nwhich was released in October 2016. Some key R packages are listed as follows.  \n\uf0b7 Shiny: Open source R pack age that provides an \nelegant and powerful web framework for building \nweb applications using R.  \uf0b7 Quantmod: The package designed to assist the quantitative trader in the development, testing, and deployment of statistically based trading models.  \n\uf0b7 Dygraphs: An R interface to the dygraphs JavaScript charting library. It provides rich facilities.  \n\uf0b7 Magrittr: The package providing a mechanism for chaining commands with a new forward-pipe operator, %>%. This operator will forward a value, or the result of an expression, into the next function call/expression. There is flexible support for the \ntype of right-hand side expressions. \nC. Picked Stocks \nDue to the variation of stock types, only five different \nstocks are picked to represent the different sectors and \nindustries. Reputed stocks are selected to inspire student interests. \n\uf0b7 AAPL: Apple, Inc. engages in the design, manufacture, and marketing of mobile communication, media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players. It represents the \u201cConsumer Goods\u201d sector in \u201cElectronic Equipment\u201d industry. \n\uf0b7 CELG: Celgene Corp. is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company, which engages in the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for the treat ment of cancer and \ninflammatory diseases. It represents the \u201cHealthcare\u201d sector in \u201cBiotechnology\u201d industry. \n\uf0b7 JPM: JPMorgan Chase & Co. operates as a financial services company worldwide. It represents the \u201cFinancial\u201d sector in \u201cMoney Center Banks\u201d industry. \n\uf0b7 XOM: Exxon Mobil Corporation is engaged in energy business. The Comp any is engaged in the \nexploration, production, transportation and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and the manufacture, transportation and sale of petroleum products. It represents the \u201cBasic Mate rials\u201d sector in \u201cMajor \nIntegrated Oil & Gas\u201d industry. \n\uf0b7 ABX: Barrick Gold Corpora tion (Barrick) is a gold \nmining company. It represents the \u201cBasic Materials\u201d sector in \u201cGold\u201d industry. \nIV. U\nSER INTERFACE DESIGN  \nDue to the educational goal of the project, the design of \nthe trading platform is to fulfill two objectives: 1) to integrate enriched c ontent for knowledge delivery, and 2) to \nbe friendly to students, who may not be comfortable with busy data environment. Thus, four panels are implemented into the user interface.  \nA. Exploring panel \nThe exploring panel (as Figure 3) is designed to \ndemonstrate real-time stock information. The content \nincludes real-time or historical stock prices and multiple indicators, such as BBand, Volumn, RSI and CCI.  \n6\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA. Downloaded on March 03,2024 at 18:58:04 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. Fig. 3.  Exploring Panel \nFurther functionalities are provided as follows. \n\uf0b7Different Time Interval Sel ection:  the time interval\ncould be for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months or 1\nyear. The default setting is for 3 months.\n\uf0b7Zoom In or Zoom Out: the user can zoom in or\nzoom out the plot easily by clicking and draging thearea.\n\uf0b7Buy Points and Sell Points: trading transactions arealso demonstrated on the plot. Buying transaction isshown as a green dot; and selling transaction isshown as a red dot.\nB.Control Panel\nControl panel (as Figure 4) is designed to enable\nstudents to pick fundamental parameter of the tradingplatform.\nFig. 4.  Control Panel \nThe first drop-down menu allows student to pick one \nof the five stocks. The second drop-down menu is for student to select one trading strategy. There are three trading strategies. The third sub component is optional, which is the time range that the user wants to do back-testing. The default range is 1/1/2016 to current. However, user can extend the starting time to 1/1/2001.      \nC.Reporting Panel\nReporting panel (as Figure 5) displays the summary of\nback-testing results. It presents the time range of back-testing, \nand gives the number and amount of buy and sell \ntransactions. The unrealized earning and total earning amount are also demonstrated.   Fig. 5.  Reporting Panel \nFurthermore, a more detailed report is provided for \nfurther analysis during back-testing.  Our system automatically generates a .txt file, which contains detail information of every transacti on. The transaction time and \nbuy/sell prices could be used to  either verify the accuracy of \nstrategy or to evolve into more comprehensive strategy later.  \nD.Strategy Panel\nStrategy panel (as Figure 6) allows student select one of\nthree trading strategies in a drop-down menu.  \nFig. 6.  Strategy Panel \nThe Simple Strategy provides a most intuitive way to \ntrade in stock market. If today is an up day (close price \nhigher than open price), buying order is set in the beginning of next trading day. If today is a down day (close price lower than open price), selling order is set in the beginning of next trading day. The strategy is for student without any experience of trading. \nThe Indicator Strategy is to simulate trading based on \nbenchmarks of technical indicators.  Students can build his/her own strategy by giving a value for each indicator. The selection condition is based on arithmetic operations, such as <, =, or >. Multiple condition statements can be connected by \nlogical operations, such as AND or OR. In addition, a \nprevious time slot (T-1) can be  considered in the Indicator \nStrategy.    \nIn order to provide the more flexibility of trading strategy, \nRScript Strategy is designed to allow self-developed trading \nmethods. Students can build their own strategy as a R function and upload the code into the system. Even though a little limitation is required in format, the approach is for students with advanced experiences of trading and R-programming.  \n7\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA.

The course contains totally 10 students, \n7 graduate-level and 3 undergraduate-level. All of students \nhave entry-level experience of R-Programming. But most of \nthem have limited experience with stock trading.  \nTwo surveys were given to students and results were \nanalyzed. The first survey is to introduce the software. Students learned how to run the system and observe related performance. The second survey focuses on the \nfunctionalities of the platform and related features. The trading strategies were em phasized. Eventually, students \nwere able to develop their own trading strategies using R-programming. An in-class competition were performed based on earnings and the winner was award bonus credit. \nBased on survey results, 100% of the students \nsuccessfully ran the system a nd all of them experienced \nsmooth installation and performance of the system. All the students agreed that the platform  is a user-friendly interface \n(see Figure 7). \nFig. 7.  Survey Results of User Satification \nRegarding the functionality survey, 100% of students \npractice the price panel while 80% understand it. Exploring panel also has as the same statistics as price panel. 90% of them could try different stocks and see the related prices and graphs. 100% of them performed zooming in and out function inside the plot successfully. 100% of the students \ncould change the time range and gets the data on that period \n(see Figure 8). \nFig. 8.  Survey Results of Function Performance \nDuring the learning of trading strategy, 100% students \nsuccessfully practiced the simple trading strategy while 90% understood it. How to build a trading strategy using the indicators was tested by 90% of the students and the process \nwas understood by 70% of them. 90% of them tested the R-\nProgramming for building a trading strategy and 90% of \nthem understood it and built their own strategies successfully. Finally, when asked about the user satisfaction, 90% of the students liked the overall system and satisfied about it (see Figure 9). \nFig. 9.  Survey Results of Trading Strategy \nVI.CONCLUSION\nDuring the education experiment, a simulated trading \nplatform was developed and deployed using RShiny. Related back testing system was also provided. The system connects \nYAHOO Finance server for real-time and historical stock information. Five classic stocks  are selected for the diversity \nof the market. Three well-defi ned indicators are used for \ntechnical trading concept. Furthermore, three different trading strategies are designed and delivered to students. It targets students with different backgrounds in trading or \nprogramming. After adopting the project into classroom, \nstudents gave positive feedbacks on the software. It approves the feasibility of the approach.  \nIn future, more functionalities and indicators will be \nintegrated into the system. Further data analysis or data science components will be emphasized and added. Artificial intelligent system is considered  as another big practice. Due \nto  the lack of similar free sy stems, we can consider this \nsystem  has big potential as a the base of an education software for data science and financial engineering.  \nA\nCKNOWLEDGMENT \nSpecial thanks for Ms. Eman Alghamdi\u2019s devoted \ncontribution to this project.
